1.Ngfor is a structural direcitve which eith adds or removes the dom elements
  it repeats the element on which it is applied.

2.Angular2 won't allow undefines refernces in interpolation etc.
Safe navigation operator allows us to avoid errors due to this
Eg:event?.name
'?' is safe navigation operator
3.Ngif a structural directive for hiding  a element based on expression
4.If frequently shown and hidden,we do not have to remove dom element.Using hidden attribute
this can be achieved
5.When multiple cases are to be dealt while displaying dom content we can use ngSwitch attribute. Th expression
in ngcase should be same type as one in ngwitch attribute

6.Classbindings- [class.green]="event?location==='Nasa'"
For multiple class use ngclass directive for styling 
[ngClass]={green:event?location==='Nasa',bold:event?location==='Smithsonian'}
